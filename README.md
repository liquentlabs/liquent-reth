# Liquent Reth: The Fastest Open-Source EVM Execution Client

For EVM-based ecosystems, the execution client is a critical component of the system stack, often representing a
significant performance bottleneck that limits on-chain throughput and raises transaction costs. While modern clients
like Reth have made substantial strides in performance, their architectures are **not** primarily optimized for
high-performance Layer 1s and Layer 2 roll-ups, which target **sub-second finality and massive scalability**, require a
fundamental rethinking of client design to overcome bottlenecks in transaction execution, state commitment, and
expensive I/O.

We introduce Liquent Reth, an open-source, performance-engineered fork of Reth, designed to push the upper bounds of EVM
execution speed. Through a suite of architectural innovations—including Levm, a DAG-based optimistic parallel EVM; a
**fully parallelized merklization** framework, a **high-performance caching** layer, an **optimized mempool,** and **a
pipelined execution architecture**—Liquent Reth achieves state-of-the-art performance.

_ERC20 Transfer Performance Comparison Across Different Account Scales_

In an ERC20 transfers benchmark across 100,000 accounts, Liquent Reth sustains ~**41,000 transactions per second (TPS)**, equivalent to ~**1.5 Gigagas/s**. This represents a greater than **4x performance boost** over the baseline `Reth 1.4.8` client.

Our primary contributions are:

1. **Levm 2.1:** A hybrid parallel EVM that integrates a Data Dependency Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with
   Block-STM-style optimistic execution. This design minimizes redundant computations in high-contention workloads and
   achieves near-optimal parallelism in low-contention scenarios.
2. **Parallel Merklization:** A complete redesign of the state root calculation process. We replace Reth's sequential,
   bottom-up MPT generation with a 16-way, top-down parallel framework that delivers a 3-10x performance increase.
3. **Liquent Cache:** A concurrent, LRU-based caching layer built with `DashMap` that provides an efficient "latest
   view" of the state, drastically reducing I/O pressure and resolving performance degradation associated with managing
   numerous in-memory blocks in high-frequency environments.
4. **Optimized Memory Pool:** A two-tier data structure and batch processing mechanism for highly concurrent transaction
   insertion and management.
5. **Pipeline Architecture:** A four-stage asynchronous pipeline (Execution, Merklization, Verification, Commit) that
   decouples execution stages, allowing Liquent Reth to effectively overlap computation and I/O and fully leverage
   multi-core processors to service rapid block production from high-throughput consensus engines.

We believe Liquent Reth represents the fastest open-source EVM execution client to date, the state-of-the-art choice for EVM chains, including Layer 1s and Layer 2 roll-ups. Our work is fundamentally open-source. We have already upstream all memory pool optimizations to the main Reth repository and are committed to continue this effort, making EVM ecosystem faster and more scalable.

## What is Reth?

Reth (short for Rust Ethereum, [pronunciation](https://x.com/kelvinfichter/status/1597653609411268608)) is a production-ready Ethereum execution layer client focused on modularity, performance, and user-friendliness. Reth is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

> **Note:** OP-Reth has moved to [ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism). Git history has been preserved.

## Goals

1. **Modularity**: Every component is built to be used as a library: well-tested, documented and benchmarked. Import crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Learn more about the project's components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).
2. **Performance**: Built with Rust, [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/), [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/), and [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/) — battle-tested and optimized for speed. Check the [ethPandaOps Lab Dashboard](https://lab.ethpandaops.io/ethereum/execution/timings) for a third-party comparison against other Ethereum clients.
Here's what that looks like in practice on Ethereum Mainnet:

3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Apache/MIT licensed, no business license restrictions.
4. **Client Diversity**: More client implementations make Ethereum more antifragile.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: Reth can sync Ethereum and other EVM chains. If you're building one, reach out.
6. **Configurability**: Profiles for different use cases — from high-performance RPC operators to hobbyists on consumer hardware.

## Status

Reth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.

- We released **Reth 2.0** in April 2026. See the [release notes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v2.0.0) and [blog post](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2026/04/releasing-reth-2-0).
- We released 1.0 "production-ready" stable Reth in June 2024.
  - Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).
  - Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://x.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)).
- We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3, 2024, the last beta release.
- We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4, 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing "history" to be mounted on separate drives.
- We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28, 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).
- We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) on June 20, 2023.

### Storage compatibility

Storage V2 is the default for new nodes in Reth 2.0. Existing V1 nodes continue to work, but V1 support will be removed in a future release — all users are encouraged to migrate. V2 snapshots are available at [snapshots.reth.rs](https://snapshots.reth.rs/).

- Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
- See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).

### Building and testing

<!--
When updating this, also update:
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/lint.yml
-->

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.93.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2026/01/22/Rust-1.93.0/).

See the docs for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://reth.rs/installation/source/).

To fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
cd reth
```

Next, run the tests:

```sh
cargo nextest run --workspace

# Run the Ethereum Foundation tests
make ef-tests
```

We highly recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing.
Using `cargo test` to run tests may work fine, but this is not tested and does not support more advanced features like retries for spurious failures.

> **Note**
>
> Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.

## Acknowledgements

Reth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.

None of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:

- [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.
- [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the ["Staged Sync" architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.
- [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula's [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80). Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.
