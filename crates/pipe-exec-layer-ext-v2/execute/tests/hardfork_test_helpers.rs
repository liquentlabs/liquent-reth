//! Reusable test helpers for Liquent hardfork integration tests.
//!
//! These helpers verify that contract bytecodes were correctly replaced
//! during a hardfork. They work with any hardfork by accepting
//! `(address, expected_bytecode)` slices as parameters.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use reth_evm_ethereum::hardfork::gamma::{GAMMA_SYSTEM_UPGRADES, STAKEPOOL_ADDRESSES, STAKEPOOL_BYTECODE};
//!
//! // Verify system contracts were upgraded at the hardfork block
//! verify_bytecodes_at_block(&provider, hardfork_block, GAMMA_SYSTEM_UPGRADES, "Gamma system");
//!
//! // Verify they were NOT upgraded before the hardfork block
//! verify_bytecodes_old_before_block(&provider, hardfork_block, GAMMA_SYSTEM_UPGRADES, "Gamma system");
//! ```
