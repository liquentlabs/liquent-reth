//! Liquent Alpha hardfork — one-shot `SYSTEM_CALLER` balance migration.
//!
//! On the Alpha activation block we zero the `SYSTEM_CALLER` account balance
//! (the historical sentinel ~1.158×10⁵⁸ G allocated in genesis to cover the
//! per-block system-tx base-fee bill). With the gas-exempt design active from
//! Alpha onwards (see L1+L2 wiring in
//! `crates/ethereum/evm/src/lib.rs::transact_system_txn` and
//! `pipe-exec-layer-ext-v2/.../lib.rs::execute_system_transactions`), the
//! sentinel balance is no longer needed and would otherwise pollute total-supply
//! accounting.
//!
//! Pattern lifted verbatim from `eip_2935.rs`:
//!   - Idempotency gated by `transitions_at_timestamp(current_ts, parent_ts)` — fires exactly on
//!     the activation block, reorg-safe (Liquent has immediate finality but the predicate is robust
//!     anyway).
//!   - Routes the diff through the executor's `apply_state_change` channel, which has symmetric
//!     impls in both the serial (`WrapExecutor` → `BasicBlockExecutor`) and levm
//!     (`LevmExecutor::apply_state_change`) backends, so serial == levm by construction.
//!
//! Crucially:
//!   - **nonce is preserved** (SYSTEM_CALLER auto-increments per block — clearing it would break
//!     the per-block construction sequence post-Alpha).
//!   - **code / code_hash are preserved** (defensive symmetry — the historical SYSTEM_CALLER alloc
//!     has no code, but treat the read result as ground truth so future migrations that touch a
//!     coded variant stay correct).
//!   - Only `balance` is set to `U256::ZERO`.
//!
//! With `nonce > 0`, the EIP-161 `is_empty` predicate stays false post-migration
//! and the account is never pruned by state-clear.

    //! (gas-exempt twin) — see `crates/ethereum/evm/src/parallel_execute.rs`.
